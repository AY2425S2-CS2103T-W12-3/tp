# Prof-iler

## About
Prof-iler is a management system designed to help School of Computing professors organize, track, and maintain student research records over time.

### Example usages:
  * As a starting point for a software engineering course project, providing a structured and scalable codebase.
  * As a case study for software engineering principles such as OOP
  * The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Project Features
Prof-iler provides core functionality for managing student research data efficiently:
1. **List Students** - Retrieves and displays all currently tracked students in the system.
2. **Add Student** - Allows professors to add students with their names, student ID, phone number, email, project, project progress and optional tags.
3. **Delete Student** -  Removes a student from the list based on their position in the list.

- * For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Prof-iler Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
- * This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
