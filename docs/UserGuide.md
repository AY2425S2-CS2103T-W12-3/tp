Prof-iler is a **desktop app for managing student research records, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Designed for fast typing research professors at SoC, Prof-iler helps streamline research management by organizing, tracking, and maintaining student records over time. These tasks can be done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Prof-iler application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar Prof-iler.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 id/A0253517M e/johnd@example.com pr/Prof-iler pb/72 t/Y3` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Prof-iler

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Y4` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Y4`, `t/CS t/Y4` etc.<br>
  e.g. `pr/KEYWORD...` can be used as `pr/Prof-iler` ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `pr/Project Prof-iler` (i.e. 1 time), `pr/Project Orbital Apollo` (i.e. 2 times).

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

* `log 1 l/CS2103T tutor` Edits the log of the 1st student to be `CS2103T tutor`.

### Locating students by name: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Filter for specific projects: `filter`

Filters for projects that contain all the given keywords or tags that contain any of the given keywords.
Format: `filter pr/KEYWORD...` or `filter t/KEYWORD...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `PROF-ILER` will match `prof-iler`
* The order of the given keywords does not matter. e.g. `Project Orbital` will match `Orbital Project`
* At least one fields must be provided, but not both. e.g. `filter pr/Prof-iler t/Y4` will not work.
* Whitespaces in between each keywords separates the keywords. e.g. `Project Orbital` searches for both keywords `Project` and `Orbital`
* Only the full keyword will be matched. e.g. `Prof-iler` will not match `Prof-ilers`
* Filtering for project requires the project to contain all the given keywords. e.g.`filter pr/Project Orbital` will not match students with project `Orbital` while `filter pr/Orbital` will match student with `Project Orbital`
* Filtering for tag requires the student to contain any of the given tags. e.g. `Y4` and `CS` will match any student that contain either `Y4` or `CS` or both tags.
* All the filtered students will be shown in the displayed student list to the screen.
Examples:
* `filter pr/prof-iler` returns `Charlotte Oliveiro` and `David Li` which are the two students under the project `Prof-iler`
    ![result for `filter pr/prof-iler`](images/filterProjectExample.png)
* `filter t/Y4 CS` returns `David Li` and `Irfan Ibrahim` which are the students that contain at least one of the given keywords for the tag.
    ![result for `filter t/CS2103T t/Tutor](images/filterTagExample.png)

### Sorting based on progress: `sort`

Sorts the student based on the progress, in either ascending or descending order.

Format: `sort asc` or `sort desc`

* The order `asc` or `desc` is case-insensitive.
* `asc` will sort the students based on ascending order of progress and `desc` will sort the students based on descending order of progress.
* All the sorted students will be shown in the displayed student list to the screen.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** <br>
Use `list` command to return back to the original list after commands such as `sort`, `filter` and `find`. <br>
The `sort` command works in conjunction with the `filter` command. <br>
For example, the user can first apply a `filter` command (e.g. `filter pr/Prof-iler`) to view the students in the project that contains the word Prof-iler. After filtering, user can execute `sort desc` to arrange students in those project based on their progress in descending order. <br>
This can also be done the other way round by applying the `sort` command first followed by `filter` command.
</div>

**Example usage of `filter pr/Prof-iler` followed by `sort desc`:**
    ![SortWithFilterCommand](images/sortFilterCommandExample.png)

### Deleting students : `delete`

Deletes the specified student from Prof-iler.

Format: `delete INDEX [,INDEXES] ...`

* Deletes the student(s) at the specified `INDEX` or `INDEXES`.
* The indexes refer to the index numbers shown in the displayed student list.
* The indexes **must be positive integers** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Indexes can be specified in a list separated by commas `,`, allowing for multiple deletions in a single command.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in Prof-iler.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.
* delete 1, 3, 4 deletes the 1st, 3rd, and 4th students from the displayed list in Prof-iler.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from Prof-iler, or clears a given project.

Format: `clear [PROJECT]`

* If no project is given, all the entries are cleared.
* The project field is case-insensitive.
* All the students under the project will be cleared.

A pop-up message to confirm your action will appear. It defaults to `No` to prevent accidental deletion.

![clear message](images/clearMessage.png)

Simply use keyboard tab or arrow keys to toggle between the options. Press `enter` on your keyboard to confirm the selection. Alternatively, you can also click on the buttons using your cursor.

Examples:
* `clear` clears all entries.
* `clear prof-iler` clears `Charlotte Oliveiro` and `David Li` which are the two students under the project `Prof-iler`.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Saving the data

Prof-iler data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Prof-iler data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/prof-iler.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Prof-iler will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Prof-iler application to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Prof-iler home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
